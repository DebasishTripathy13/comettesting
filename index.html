    <h2>Harnessing AI to End Hunger and Food Waste</h2>
    <p>
      The AI Food Pantry is a pioneering initiative that merges artificial intelligence with compassion. 
      By leveraging machine learning, we predict food demand in communities, track surplus inventory, 
      and coordinate timely deliveries to those in need. Our mission is to ensure no meal goes to waste 
      and every family has access to nutritious food.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our system learns continuously — analyzing local data, weather trends, and social factors that influence 
      food supply and demand. Volunteers and partners use the AI dashboard to make data-driven decisions that 
      maximize impact while minimizing waste.
    </p>

    <p>
      Technology can bridge the gap between abundance and need. Through collaboration, innovation, 
      and empathy, the AI Food Pantry is redefining how communities care for one another.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every donation, every data point, and every volunteer hour contributes to a smarter, fairer, 
      and more sustainable future.
