    <h2>Harnessing AI to End Hunger and Food Waste</h2>
    <p>
      The AI Food Pantry is a pioneering initiative that merges artificial intelligence with compassion. 
      By leveraging machine learning, we predict food demand in communities, track surplus inventory, 
      and coordinate timely deliveries to those in need. Our mission is to ensure no meal goes to waste 
      and every family has access to nutritious food.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our system learns continuously — analyzing local data, weather trends, and social factors that influence 
      food supply and demand. Volunteers and partners use the AI dashboard to make data-driven decisions that 
      maximize impact while minimizing waste.
    </p>

    <p>
      Technology can bridge the gap between abundance and need. Through collaboration, innovation, 
      and empathy, the AI Food Pantry is redefining how communities care for one another.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every donation, every data point, and every volunteer hour contributes to a smarter, fairer, 
      and more sustainable future.

Unsubscribe from a promotional email or newsletter
An animation demonstrating how to unsubscribe from a sender in Gmail on a computer. The user opens a web browser and goes to mail.google.com. In their inbox, they open an email and click the "Unsubscribe" link at the top. A confirmation message shows that the user has been unsubscribed.

Important: To unsubscribe, some senders may require you to go to their website. Instead of an unsubscribe option, you get a "Go to website" option in the email.

On your computer, go to Gmail.
Open an email you want to unsubscribe from.
Next to the sender's name, click Unsubscribe.
In the pop-up, click Unsubscribe or Go to website.
Tips:

When you unsubscribe from a specific email, it might only unsubscribe you from a single mailing list from the sender. To unsubscribe and locate all active subscriptions from a sender, on the left, click More and then Manage subscriptions. Learn how to manage your subscriptions in Gmail.
When you unsubscribe, instead of the sender’s name, you may find a unique identifier for a mailing list or list ID.
